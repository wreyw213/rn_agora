sign in or create an account. Once you have signed in, you can either
start a video call with a user or join a call by entering a room ID.

During a call, you can use the freehand drawing feature by clicking the
\"Draw\" button in the bottom right corner of the screen. This will
bring up a canvas where you can draw using your finger or a stylus. Once
you have finished drawing, you can save or share your drawing with other
participants in the call.
